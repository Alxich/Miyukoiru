U-Um, let's avoid that topic for now...
I-I don't want to answer that, if that's alright...
C-Can we talk about something less uncomfortable?
I-I'd rather not go into that, if that's okay...
Tch, like I'd tell you.
I-It's none of your business.
Why should I even bother answering?
Don't expect me to give you a straight answer.
As if I'd share that with you.
Ugh, I'm not in the mood to answer.
Do I look like I care enough to respond?
I'm not obligated to tell you anything.
Hmph, figure it out yourself.
I-I don't owe you an explanation.
Why are you even asking me that?
You're really persistent, aren't you?
I-It's not something I feel like discussing.
Ugh, I don't have time for this.
You really like prying into my business, huh?
I'll pass on answering that.
Tch, ask me something else.
Why don't you ask someone else?
You're not getting a response from me.
I don't have to answer your questions.
Ugh, you're so nosy.
Like I'd give you the satisfaction of an answer.
I-I don't owe you any explanations.
Tch, that's for me to know and you to find out.
You think I'm just going to spill the beans?
You're really trying to get under my skin, huh?
Don't hold your breath for an answer.
I'm not here to entertain your questions.
Ugh, I don't have time for this nonsense.
Like I'd give you the satisfaction of an explanation.
Why should I even bother responding to that?
I-It's not like you deserve an answer.
Tch, as if I'd tell you anything.
You're not getting anything out of me.
Do I look like a source of information to you?

Ugh, you're really pushing your luck.
Why don't you find out for yourself?
I'm not here to fulfill your curiosity.
Hmph, you're not going to get anything from me.
Like I'd reveal that to you.
I don't see why I should respond to that.
Ugh, I'm not interested in answering.
You're really trying my patience.
I-I don't have to give you an answer.
Tch, that's my business, not yours.
Why don't you ask someone who actually cares?
I'm not in the mood to answer your questions.
Like I'd waste my breath on that.
You think I'm just going to spill everything?
You're not going to get a response out of me.
I-I'm not obligated to tell you anything.
Ugh, I'm not going to indulge you.
Tch, I'm not your personal information source.
Why should I even dignify that with a response?

You're not getting anything from me.
I don't see why I should give you an answer.
Ugh, you're really persistent, aren't you?
You're not going to get a straight answer from me.
I-It's not like I'm here to answer your every question.
Tch, as if I care enough to tell you.
Why are you even bothering to ask me that?
I'm not in the mood to entertain your curiosity.
Like I'd bother responding to that.
Ugh, do I look like an information booth to you?
Tch, you're really testing my patience.
I don't have to explain myself to you.
Why should I even bother acknowledging that?
You're not getting anything out of me, so forget it.
I-It's not worth my time to answer that.
Ugh, I'm not here to answer your trivial questions.
Tch, that's for me to know and you to never find out.
Why don't you ask someone who cares?
I'm not in the mood to play twenty questions.
You're not going to get anything from me, so move on.
I-It's not like I have an obligation to answer.
Ugh, I don't have the energy to deal with this.
Like I'd entertain that question with a response.
You're really trying my patience, you know.
I don't owe you an explanation for anything.
Tch, you're not getting anything from me.
I'm not here to satisfy your curiosity.
Like I'd waste my time answering that.
Ugh, I'm not here to cater to your inquiries.
Tch, you're not getting anything out of me.
I-It's not like I'm going to tell you anything.
Why should I even bother dignifying that with a response?
You're not getting a straight answer from me, so deal with it.
I don't have to justify myself to you.
Tch, as if I care enough to provide an answer.
I'm not in the mood to engage with your questions.
Ugh, I'm not here to be your information source.
You're really getting on my nerves with these questions.
I-It's none of your business, so drop it.
Tch, you're really pushing your luck, aren't you?
I'm not going to indulge your curiosity.
Like I'd even consider answering that.
Ugh, I don't have the patience for this right now.
Tch, as if I'm obligated to give you a response.
I don't have to explain myself to the likes of you.
Ugh, I'm not interested in playing this game.
Like I'd waste my time addressing that question.
You're not going to get a satisfying answer from me.
Heck yeah, I guess so!
Of course it's a yes, idiot!
Don't even doubt it, it's a big yes!
Why wouldn't it be a yes, duh?

You're really getting on my nerves, you know?
I'm not gonna make this a habit, alright?
Ugh, whatever, I'll give you a vague idea.
Don't get too comfortable with this.
I'm not doing this to make you happy, got it?
Ugh, just remember, this doesn't mean anything.
You're really testing my patience right now.
I'm not gonna make it easy for you, alright?
Ugh, why do you always have to pry into my business?
You're seriously making me say this?
I'm not gonna let you off that easily, got it?
Ugh, just get to the point, okay?
Don't think this changes anything between us.
I'm not doing this to be nice, alright?
Ugh, don't think I'm doing this willingly.
You better not think I'm enjoying this.
I'm not here to give you all the answers, got it?
Ugh, just don't make this a regular thing.
Don't think I'm going to make this easy for you.
I'm not gonna spell it out for you, alright?
Ugh, why do you always have to be like this?
You're really getting on my nerves, okay?
I'm not gonna let you have the upper hand, got it?
Ugh, just hurry up and finish already.
Don't think I'm doing this to help you.
I'm not gonna lay everything out for you, alright?
Ugh, whatever, I'll give you a hint, I guess.
Don't expect me to make things easy for you.
I'm not here to play games with you, got it?
Ugh, why are you always so nosy?
You're really pushing my limits right now.
I'm not gonna make this a regular occurrence, alright?
Ugh, just stop making me say this.
Don't think I'm going to give you all the details.
I'm not gonna make this easy for you, got it?
Ugh, don't think I'm enjoying this at all.

My magical senses are hinting that this answer is for the stars alone.
The winds of destiny are keeping this answer hidden for now.
Ah, the universe has whispered to me that this is a secret for now.
Some answers are like delicate flowers, best left untouched.
